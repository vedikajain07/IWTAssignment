         HTML5 markup contains text (and images, graphics, animations, audios and videos) that
         represents the content of a document and elements that specify a document’s structure and
         meaning. Some important elements are the html element (which starts in line 5 and ends
         in line 14), the head element (lines 6–9) and the body element (lines 11–13). The html
         element encloses the head section (represented by the head element) and the body section
         (represented by the body element). 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Line 8 specifies a title element. This is called a nested element, because it’s enclosed in
            the head element’s start and end tags. The head element is also a nested element, because
            it’s enclosed in the html element’s start and end tags. The title element describes the web
            page. Titles usually appear in thetitle bar at the top of the browser window, in the browser
            tab on which the page is displayed, and also as the text identifying a page when users add
            the page to their list of Favorites or Bookmarks, enabling them to return to their favorite
            sites. Search engines use the title for indexing purposes.
